The RubyInstaller version 1.9.2-p0 is now available for download in installer and 7-Zip binary archive formats along with CHM documentation. We’re also releasing our brand new self-extracting archive DevKit’s in both GCC 3.4.5 and 4.5.0 versions.
We’ve been busy upgrading our build recipes and toolchain from GCC 3.4.5 to GCC 4.5.0 and have had great success in building Ruby, its dependencies, many native RubyGems, and other non-Ruby related projects. Since we’ve had such good results we’ve decided to make it official by switching to the GCC 4.5.0 toolchain for future releases.
In addition, we’ve updated the DevKit to use the newer GCC 4.5.0 technology as well as worked to simplify the DevKit installation and usage experience. We’re not quite finished with the ease-of-use enhancements to the DevKit, but we think you’ll like the easy-to-install self-extracting archives and Ruby installation helper script. Check out the [DevKit wiki page](http://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit) for all the details.
Enjoy and let us know what you think at our [RubyInstaller Group](http://groups.google.com/group/rubyinstaller) page!
